Option 1: House Price Predictor
Overarching goal: Create a service to predict housing price
House Price Prediction
• Get and read a large data set
• Get an understanding of what is going on
• Process and wrangle the data
• Build a simple regression model using SKLearn • Improve the model and do data analysis
Things to Research
• Making a network request for data
• Pandas, using a dataframe, plotting • SKLearn and linear regression model
Extension Suggestions
• Implement a linear regression class yourself
• Visualize and evaluate the data in new ways (correlation)
• Use more variables (intelligently)
• Compare different regression models
• Create a simple application that can let people enter information and get an estimate of their house price (like Zillow)
• Visually and descriptively compare your results to Zillow or other sites

For the project, you will solve a problem using data by:
• Programmatically download a data-set for analysis. The data is available here: GitHub
• Load the data-set into Python using a data structure (Data Frame).
• Understand and interpret the data-set.
• Visualize aspects of the data-set.
• Use Machine Learning techniques to solve the problem and perform the analysis. • Customize your project through extension tasks.
